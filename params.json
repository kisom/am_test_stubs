{"body":"This project provides quick-start templates to add unit tests to your\r\nC code using [CUnit](http://cunit.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\n### What's provided\r\n\r\n* `Makefile.am` has a few lines in it relevant to unit testing; they just\r\nneed to be integrated into the current build.\r\n* `pre-commit` is a simple script that can be used in git (by copying to\r\n`.git/hooks/`) or mercurial (in the `[hooks]` section of `.hg/hgrc`, add\r\n`pretxncommit.build = ./pre-commit`) to prevent commiting when builds and\r\nunit tests are failing. For larger projects, this may not be feasible;\r\nhowever, it may be useful for smaller projects.\r\n* `tests/Makefile.am` demonstrates a skeleton Makefile template for building\r\nthe tests.\r\n* `tests/stub_test.c` is just a skeleton test; make sure to pass it\r\n`-DTEST_SUITE=\"\\\"your_test_name\\\"\" in the CFLAGS (see `tests/Makefile.am`).\r\n\r\n### Using\r\n0. Create the initial `tests` directory:\r\n`cp -r /path/to/this/repo/tests /path/to/your/code`\r\n0. Make sure the tests are called in your top level `Makefile.am`. Consult\r\nthe `./Makefile.am` provided here if you aren't sure what to add.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n`am_stub_tests` is provided under an\r\n[ISC license](https://raw.github.com/kisom/am_test_stubs/master/LICENSE).\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nKyle Isom (kyle `:at` tyrfingr `:dot:` is) put this together.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
